          The goal of the FDA's second precisionFDA challenge, similarly to the first challenge, is to continue engaging the genomics community in advancing the quality standards in order to achieve more accurate and consistent results in the context of genetic tests (related to whole human genome sequencing), advancing the goal of better personalized care.

      <p>
        In the context of whole human genome sequencing, software pipelines typically rely on mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome and subsequently identifying variants (differences). One way of assessing the performance of such pipelines is by using well-characterized datasets such as Genome in a Bottle’s NA12878, also known as HG001. However, we have been hearing from the community that HG001 has been widely used to train software pipelines, and that testing of pipelines would ideally be done on some other sample &mdash; perhaps one whose truth data is not provided at the time of testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Genome in a Bottle (GiaB) consortium, lead by the National Institute of Standards (NIST), will be soon releasing a second reference sample, known as HG002, corresponding to their characterization of NA24385 (the son of an Ashkenazim trio).
      </p>
      <p>
        The FDA has taken this unique opportunity, before the release of the HG002 truth data by GiaB, to set up the second precisionFDA challenge. By supplying sequencing reads datasets (FASTQ) for both HG001 and HG002, and a framework for comparing variant call format (VCF) results, this challenge provides a common frame of reference for measuring performance aspects of participants’ pipelines on both known (HG001) and not-yet-revealed (HG002) truth datasets.

        The challenge begins with two precisionFDA-provided input datasets, corresponding to whole-genome sequencing of the HG001 (NA12878) and HG002 (NA24385) human samples. Both samples were sequenced under similar sequencing conditions and instruments, at the same sequencing site. Your mission is to process these two FASTQ datasets through your mapping and variation calling pipeline and create VCF files. You can generate those results on your own environment, and upload them to precisionFDA, or you can reconstruct your pipeline on precisionFDA and run it there. Regardless of how you generate your VCF files, you will subsequently submit them as your entry to the challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        For HG002, the truth data will not be known during the challenge. After submissions close on May 26, GiaB will publish their reference VCF file for HG002. The precisionFDA team will then run and publish comparisons between each contestant’s HG002 VCF file and the GiaB HG002 reference VCF. This will publicly reveal how similar is each result to the GiaB HG002 reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        For HG001, the reference VCF is already available. You are therefore asked to conduct a comparison between your VCF and the GiaB HG001 (NA12878) reference VCF, and include it in your submission entry, for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>to ensure that your VCF files are compatible with the comparison process (remember that we won’t be able to check on your HG002 VCF until after the end of submissions, so you are using your HG001 VCF as a check that your files can be compared without issues)</li>
        <li>for the community to be able to contrast your performance on a previously known sample (HG001) versus a previously unknown (HG002), and to evaluate any overfitting on HG001</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      Your entry to the challenge comprises your submitted HG001 and HG002 VCFs, your submitted HG001 comparison, and the HG002 comparison conducted by precisionFDA. Each comparison outputs several metrics (such as precision<a href="#footnotes">*</a>, recall<a href="#footnotes">*</a>, f-measure, or number of common variants). Selected participants and winners<a href="#footnotes">**</a> will be recognized on the precisionFDA website. Therefore, we hope you are willing to share your experience with others to further enhance the community's effort to ensure accuracy and truth of tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge runs until May 26, 2016.

            After familiarizing yourself with the input files, you will need to process them through your mapping and variation calling pipeline to generate corresponding VCF files. Your pipeline must call variants across the whole genome. Each invocation of your pipeline must take as input a pair of FASTQ files and produce a VCF file containing exactly one genotyped sample. Results must be reported on GRCh37 human coordinates (i.e. chromosomes named 1, 2, ..., X, Y, and MT). You are strongly encouraged to compress each VCF file with bgzip, to reduce the file size.

            Besides running your pipeline in your own environment, you have the additional option of reconstructing your pipeline on precisionFDA and running it there. To do that, you must create one or more apps on precisionFDA that encapsulate the actions performed in your pipeline.

The precisionFDA website contains <a href="https://precision.fda.gov/docs/creating_apps">extensive documentation</a> on how to create apps, and you can also click the <strong>Fork</strong> button on an existing app (such as <a href="https://precision.fda.gov/apps/app-BpF9YGQ0bxjbjk6Fx1F0KJF0">bwa_mem_bamsormadup</a>) to use it as starting point for developing your own.

            The HG001 comparison is between your HG001 VCF and the NIST/GiaB v2.19 benchmark VCF file for the same sample, constrained within the coordinates of the accompanying GiaB v2.19 BED file. The precisionFDA website provides NA12878-NISTv2.19.vcf.gz (to be used as benchmark VCF) and NA12878-NISTv2.19.bed (to be used as benchmark BED). This comparison is meant to estimate the accuracy of your pipeline within the “confident” regions of the Genome in a Bottle HG001 truth dataset &mdash; therefore you must leave the test BED entry blank.

            Your comparison is private, until you are ready to share it with the community (see "Submitting your entry" below).

            <p>To ensure that you are on the right track, your HG001 comparison must meet a precision* and recall* threshold of at least 90%.</p>

            In your answer’s text, please identify whether you are participating as an individual or as part of the team (and, if it is a team effort, don’t forget to identify the members of your team). Write a description of the pipeline used to obtain the results, and identify the name, version and command-line parameters of the mapper and variant caller invoked in your pipeline.

            <strong>NOTE</strong>
            <p>If you opted to construct your pipeline on precisionFDA, and your VCFs were generated by running one or more precisionFDA apps, the system will automatically prompt you to share the details of these executions when publishing your answer (see below). In that case, your text only needs to provide a high-level summary, because the exact software invocations will be available to the community via the system’s sharing mechanism.</p>

            Once you save your answer, it is initially private (and only visible to you). You can go back at any point and edit it, so we encourage you to start drafting it right away, and revise it as you make progress. Once you instantiate your answer, you can attach your VCFs and your HG001 comparison to it by visiting each item and clicking Attach, and selecting your answer. Your entry must contain two VCF files (one for HG001 and one for HG002) and the HG001 comparison (as outlined in the previous section) in order to be considered valid.
          </p>
          <p class="copy">
            Once you are comfortable with your answer, you can publish it so that others can see it (and don’t worry – you can still edit it or update its attachments even after publication). When publishing, the system will ask if you want to publish the comparisons, as well as the VCF files that were input to the comparisons; please choose that option to ensure that these artifacts are shared with the precisionFDA community. Entries that do not have their comparisons and VCF files published will not be considered valid. If you used apps on precisionFDA (instead of generating these VCF files externally), please choose the option to share the underlying jobs, apps, and app assets.

            All valid submitted entries, after vetted by precisionFDA, and after meeting minimum criteria for performance on HG002, will receive an acknowledgement for participation in the challenge. Among these entries, the precisionFDA team will select a few winners** to be recognized on the precisionFDA website. Winning criteria may include, but are not limited to, comparison metrics on HG002 (such as precision*, recall*, f-measure). For more information about the metrics output by the comparison, consult the precisionFDA docs.
