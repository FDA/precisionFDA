        In the context of whole human genome sequencing, software pipelines typically rely on mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome and subsequently identifying variants (differences). One way of assessing the performance of such pipelines is by using well-characterized datasets such as Genome in a Bottle’s NA12878.
      </p>
      <p>
        By supplying NA12878 whole-genome sequencing read datasets (FASTQ), and a framework for comparing variant call format (VCF) results, this challenge provides a common frame of reference for measuring some of the aspects of reproducibility and accuracy of participants’ pipelines.

        The challenge begins with two precisionFDA-provided input datasets, corresponding to whole-genome sequencing of the NA12878 human sample at two different sequencing sites. Your mission is to process these FASTQ files through your mapping and variation calling pipeline and create VCF files. For one of the datasets, you are required to do a rerun of your pipeline and obtain a rerun VCF as well. You can generate those results on your own environment, and upload them to precisionFDA, or you can reconstruct your pipeline on precisionFDA and run it on the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of how you generate your VCF files, you will subsequently use the precisionFDA comparison framework to conduct several pairwise comparisons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>By comparing the rerun VCF to the original one, you will evaluate your pipeline’s reproducibility with respect to the same exact input file.</li>
        <li>By comparing the VCF files of the two datasets, you will evaluate reproducibility on the same sample across different sites.</li>
        <li>By comparing each of your three VCF files to the NIST (Genome in a Bottle) benchmark VCF, you will get estimates for accuracy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The complete set of these five comparisons constitutes your submission entry to the challenge. Each comparison outputs several metrics (such as precision<a href="#footnotes">*</a>, recall<a href="#footnotes">*</a>, f-measure, or number of non-common variants). Selected participants and winners<a href="#footnotes">**</a> will be recognized on the precisionFDA website. Therefore, we hope you are willing to share your experience with others to further enhance the community's effort to ensure consistency of tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge runs until April 25, 2016.

            After familiarizing yourself with the input files, you will need to process them through your mapping and variation calling pipeline to generate corresponding VCF files. Your pipeline must call variants across the whole genome. Each invocation of your pipeline must take as input a pair of FASTQ files and produce a VCF file containing exactly one genotyped sample. Results must be reported on GRCh37 human coordinates (i.e. chromosomes named 1, 2, ..., X, Y, and MT). You are strongly encouraged to compress each VCF file with bgzip, to reduce the file size.

            Besides running your pipeline in your own environment, you have the additional option of reconstructing your pipeline on precisionFDA and running it on the cloud. To do that, you must create one or more apps on precisionFDA that encapsulate the actions performed in your pipeline. To create an app, you can provide Linux executables and an accompanying shell script to be run inside an Ubuntu VM on the cloud. The precisionFDA website contains <a href="https://precision.fda.gov/docs/creating_apps">extensive documentation</a> on how to create apps, and you can also click the <strong>Fork</strong> button on an existing app (such as <a href="https://precision.fda.gov/apps/app-BpF9YGQ0bxjbjk6Fx1F0KJF0">bwa_mem_bamsormadup</a>) to use it as starting point for developing your own.

            In your answer’s text, please identify whether you are participating as an individual or as part of the team (and, if it is a team effort, don’t forget to identify the members of your team).

            <strong>NOTE</strong>
            <p>If you opted to construct your pipeline on precisionFDA, and your VCFs were generated by running one or more precisionFDA apps, the system will automatically prompt you to share the details of these executions when publishing your answer (see below). In that case, your text only needs to provide a high-level summary, because the exact software invocations will be available to the community via the system’s sharing mechanism.</p>

            Once you save your answer, it is initially private (and only visible to you). You can go back at any point and edit it, so we encourage you to start drafting it right away, and revise it as you make progress. Once you instantiate your answer, you can attach your comparisons to it – visit each of your comparisons and click Attach, then select your answer. Your entry must contain the five comparisons (as outlined in the previous section) in order to be considered valid.

          <p class="copy">
            Once you are comfortable with your answer, you can publish it so that others can see it (and don’t worry – you can still edit it or update its attachments even after publication). When publishing, the system will ask if you want to publish the comparisons, as well as the VCF files that were input to the comparisons; please choose that option to ensure that these artifacts are shared with the precisionFDA community. Entries that do not have their comparisons and VCF files published will not be considered valid. If you used apps on precisionFDA (instead of generating these VCF files externally), please choose the option to share the underlying jobs, apps, and app assets.

            <strong>NOTE</strong>
            <p>It is possible for a pipeline to try to reach maximum precision<a href="#footnotes">*</a> by being trivially strict, or maximum recall<a href="#footnotes">*</a> by being trivially lenient. To avoid very extreme entries, and to ensure fairness in the competition, the challenge requires that all submitted accuracy comparisons reach a minimum threshold of 90% for each of the precision<a href="#footnotes">*</a> and the recall<a href="#footnotes">*</a> statistics. Entries that do not meet these criteria or are otherwise not deemed valid will not be considered.</p>

            Comparing VCF results is a difficult problem (partly due to the fact that the same variant can be represented in many ways), but becomes more tractable for the case of a pairwise comparison. The reproducibility portion of this challenge leverages the precisionFDA pairwise comparison framework to assess the similarity between two pipeline invocations at a time, but extending it beyond two trials may not be as straightforward.
          </p>
          <p class="copy">
            How would you assess reproducibility across more than two repeated experiments? What is an ideal method for comparing multiple (more than two) VCF files? How tractable is a seemingly simple calculation such as “count the number of variants that are common (reproducible) among a set of VCF files”? Please include any software solutions, links to tools or scripts, etc.
