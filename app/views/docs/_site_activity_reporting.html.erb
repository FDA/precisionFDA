          Site activity reporting gives the admin aggregated data about the resource utilization of precisionFDA users. This dashboard has pre-selected time periods (past day, week, month, year as shown below) as well as the ability to select a custom date range. By default, the dashboard shows usage for the current week (starting on Sunday).

        <p>The dashboard is divided into four sections:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Users: the numbers of site views, access requests, and logins.</li>
          <li>Data: the amount of data uploaded, downloaded, and generated by running comparisons, apps, and workflows.</li>
          <li>Apps: the numbers of apps created, published, and run, and the number of jobs run. There is also a summary of the total apps ever published to precisionFDA, the number of public apps, and the total number of CPU hours used for running jobs.</li>
          <li>Challenges: the numbers of challenge signups and submissions.</li>
        </ol>

          The Users & Usage button presents a table with fine grained detail about the resource usage of each user. The table shows current storage usage as well as compute and consumption in pre-defined data ranges. Note that the storage usage is only an estimate based on a snapshot, but it will be illustrative of the relative levels of storage usage amongst users.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along the top of the table, there are fields with which to filter the rows visible in the table. Users can be filtered by name, storage can be filtered by a range of sizes, compute can be filtered by a range of dollar amounts, and consumption can be filtered by a range of Bytes-Hours values. If either field in a range is left blank, it is assumed to be the extreme value, i.e. zero for the left field and the maximum value across all users for the right field.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          You may also select a custom data range, for which the results are shown in additional columns of the table (“Compute/Consumption in Custom Range”).
        </p>

        <p>
          Clicking the “Export to CSV” button exports the table to a CSV formatted file to be looked at offline.
