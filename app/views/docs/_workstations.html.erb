        <p>Workstations are a class of apps on precisionFDA that are "interactive". Most apps on precisionFDA are
          non-interactive: you provide inputs, the app follows a set script, and creates outputs if it finishes
          successfully. Workstations are interactive; they create an environment where the user may enter any command
          they choose.</p>

      <div id="workstation-types" class="h2">Workstation Types</div>
      <div class="bs-docs-section">
        <p>There are currently two types of Workstations on precisionFDA:</p>
        <p>1) <strong>TTYD</strong> - this Workstation provides an Ubuntu command-line terminal interface.</p>
        <p>2) <strong>JupyterLab</strong> - this Workstation provides a JupyterLab server graphical interface. The
          Jupyter interface supports running Python or R notebooks, as well as a built-in terminal.</p>

        <p>In order to run a Workstation, your account needs additional authorization. You can request Workstations
          authorization by sending an email to precisionFDA Support (precisionfda-support@dnanexus.com).</p>
        <p>If you do not have authorization, you will receive an error message when you click "Run" on a Workstation
          app.</p>

        <p>Workstations may be found in the public Apps repository, similar to other apps.</p>
        <p>Here are links to current Workstations:</p>
        <p><a href="https://precision.fda.gov/home/apps/app-G1gY2BQ0KJ893JfK3jBYP2v5-1">TTYD Workstation, for command

          creating and running Jupyter notebooks</a></p>
        <p>When you launch a Workstation, it will take 2-5 minutes for the worker to initialize. Once the Execution page
          states that the execution is "Running", you may access the Workstation. A link will appear in the middle of
          the page, labeled "Open."

      <div class="bs-docs-section">
        <p>When you run a Workstation, you have full admin access on the worker, as well as unrestricted internet

        <p>You may install packages with "sudo pip" or "sudo apt-get".</p>
        <p><code>sudo apt-get install pigz</code></p>

      <div class="bs-docs-section">
        <p>Workstations have full access to your private files in your precisionFDA cloud environment. You can interact
          with these files using <code>dx</code> commands:</p>
        <pre style="white-space: pre-line;">
   dx ls
   dx download
   dx upload
        </pre>
        <p><code>dx ls</code> will show all files on your private precisionFDA area.</p>
        <p><code>dx download <$filename></code> will download a file from precisionFDA to the local worker. You may use
          an asterisk to indicate multiple files.</p>
        <p><code>dx upload <$filename></code> will upload a file from the local worker to your precisionFDA private
          area. You may upload multiple files using an asterisk.</p>
        <p><i>NOTE: your files will not appear on precisionFDA until file syncing occurs, which happens either by clicking the "Sync Now" button on the Execution detail page, or automatically upon termination of the Workstation execution.</i></p>
      </div>
      <div id="workstation-snapshots" class="h2">Creating snapshots on Workstations</div>
      <div class="bs-docs-section">
        <p>Workstations support the ability to create a snapshot, which takes a picture of all modifications to the
          Workstation since it was launched and can be seen as a "save point". The snapshot action creates a tarball
          that contains all modified files, which is placed in a user's precisionFDA private area as a *.snapshot data
          object.</p>
        <p>After a snapshot file is created, a new execution of a Workstation may be launched, with the snapshot data
          object as an optional input. If a snapshot is provided as input, it will be unpacked on the worker instance
          and all files will be placed in the locations where they were located when the snapshot was created.</p>
        <p>To take a snapshot in the TTYD Workstation, run the command:</p>
        <p><code>dx-create-snapshot</code></p>
        <p>To take a snapshot with the JupyterLab Workstation, click on the "snapshot" option under the "precisionFDA"
          menu in the top menu bar.</p>
        <p>Once created and synched (via termination of the Workstation), a snapshot file will appear in your private
          Files area. You can recognize these files, as they will end in ".snapshot". This file may be an optional input
          to a new Workstation execution.</p>
        <p><i>NOTE: In order to run the snapshot generation command, Python2.7 must be included in the $PYTHONPATH
          variable. Installing Python managers, such as Conda/BioConda, may alter this path. If you see a failure to
          generate the snapshot, check to see if this path has been changed by running
          <code>echo $PYTHONPATH</code>.</i></p>
      </div>
      <div id="workstation-terminating" class="h2">Terminating Workstations</div>
      <div class="bs-docs-section">
        <p><strong>TTYD</strong> Workstations will terminate after 30 days.</p>

        <p><strong>Jupyter</strong> Workstations will terminate after 4 hours (240 minutes) by default. This timeout can
          be adjusted, either by providing a custom duration as an input or by using the "Adjust Duration" option in the
          Jupyter interface.</p>
        <p>You can terminate a Workstation at any time by selecting "Terminate" from the Execution detail page.</p>

        <p>Any uploaded files on a Workstation, pushed to the cloud using `dx upload`, will <strong>not</strong> appear
          on precisionFDA in your private area until the execution is synced, or until it is terminated.  This syncing will happen automatically upon execution termination, but can be triggered to happen earlier by clicking on "Sync now" on the Execution detail page.</p>
        <p>Note that after a Workstation is terminated, any files on the worker are no longer accessible! Make sure to
          upload your work, or take a snapshot of the worker, before terminating.</p>
