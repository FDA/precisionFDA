                During the life-cycle of FDA regulated products, FDA collects data from a diversity of sources including voluntary reports from healthcare providers and patients. While cause and effect are not always conclusive or relevant in these reports, valuable insights into the impact of regulated products on public health have been found in individual reports and in evaluation of reported data. This challenge engages data scientists to use evolving data science techniques to identify anomalies that may lead to valuable public health information.
